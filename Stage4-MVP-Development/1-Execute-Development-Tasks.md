# Task 1: Execute Development Tasks

## Purpose
To implement sprint features following coding standards, version control protocols, and QA procedures, ensuring code quality and system stability.

---

## Development Execution Overview
Developers worked on assigned tasks with parallel backend/frontend development. SCM and QA processes were integrated throughout.

---

## Development Activities
**Team Responsibilities:**
- Implemented sprint features per technical specifications
- Maintained clean, documented code following team standards
- Updated project documentation to reflect changes

**Features Delivered:**
- Product listing interface (UI + API)
- Order creation system (frontend + backend)
- Backend APIs (products, orders)
- Full frontend-backend integration

---

## Source Code Management (GitHub)
**Best Practices Applied:**
- Feature branch strategy for each major task
- No direct commits to `main` branch
- Pull Request reviews before merging
- Code review checklists

**Branch Structure:**

Branch Structure

The project followed a structured branching model including main, develop, and feature/* branches. All development work was conducted in feature branches and merged only after successful code review.

SCM Ownership

Source Code Management (SCM) responsibilities were handled by the Project Manager, ensuring compliance with branching strategies, pull request reviews, and merge policies.

QA Execution & Testing Tools

Quality Assurance activities were conducted after the completion of each major task. Backend APIs were tested using Postman, while frontend features were validated through manual user interface testing to ensure functional correctness.

Sprint Completion Criteria

The sprint was considered complete when all assigned tasks were implemented, reviewed, merged into the develop branch, and passed QA testing with no critical or blocking defects.

Sprint Output

This task resulted in a stable and functional implementation of the planned sprint features, including product listing, order management, and full frontend-backend integration, ready for sprint review and further enhancement.
